# Overview

This is a program that covers some basic concepts of the statistical computing and graphical presentation programming language R.

To demonstrate the R language in my program, I provide examples of printing output to the screen, the common data types, loops that work with lists or arrays, data frames, and finally, I incorporate a csv file.
